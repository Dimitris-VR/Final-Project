# Final-Project
About This project is designed to simulate a full workflow of a Data Analyst from getting data off the Database to manipulate it with the use of Python and Pandas module to present it through matplotlib module or Tableau.

## The following steps are just a recommendation, we suggest you trying and think outside the box while working with this data and maybe take different paths.

+ Step 1.
Add the Dataset provided to Workbench.

+ Step 2.
Use a Query to get all the columns of the table between the years 2016-2019.

+ Step 3.
Export the data to an CSV file like shown below

+ Step 4.
Use Python and Pandas to Aggregate the CSV data so we can get the most popular item sold based on zip code and percentage of sales per store.

+ Step 5.
Use Matplotlib or Tableau with the newly made CSV file and present your Data.

+ Step 6.
Write a report of the steps you did and what difficulties you faced.
